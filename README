This is sIpopt version 2.0

sIpopt 2.0 is a fork of the popular NLP solver IPOPT (https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt). The difference between the two is that sIpopt 2.0 allows the explicitly declaration of parameters in the optimization problem. This enables the implementation of algorithms that are based on the partial derivatives of the lagrangian and the constraints w.r.t. these parameters, such as sensitivity calculation, etc.

sIpopt 2.0 was developed in an effort to make the implementation of sensitivity calculations cleaner and more efficient than it would be without changing some core elements of Ipopt. If you would like to calculate sensitivities of the optimal solution, but would like to use the original version of Ipopt, there is sIpopt 1.0, which is in the contrib subdirectory of the Ipopt trunk.
